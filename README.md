Windows VPN and Wireless Network Notification Icon Menu

This program is an attempt to bring a more straightforward and quick to use menu from the Windows Notification Area.
Windows 10's VPN and even wireless connection management leaves a lot to be desired in this regard, requiring excessive clicks to connect and
disconnect from both VPN networks as well as wireless networks. The intent of this program is to add a notification icon that will show a simple menu of VPN and
wireless connections and allow them to be connected or disconnected with a single click (where possible).
